When was the last time you tried smart variations to see where they took your engagement and conversion numbers?<\/p>\n<p>Granted, <i>experimentation<\/i> can sound a bit intimidating. I know because I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs who feel that \u201csocial media tests\u201d are some obscure tactics only data scientists can handle.

I\u2019m writing this article to share seven simple tests that you can run today.<\/p>\n<p>But before we begin testing, you need to lay out some metrics to input your data in for analysis.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2 class=\"section-title section-title-default \" style=\"text-align: left;\">Setup Your Metrics for Documentation<\/h2>\n<div class=\"text-element content-element\">\n<p>To make sure your test results are as clear and informative as possible, decide which metrics matter for the changes you are trying to provoke. For example, if your main social media goal is to increase shares, prioritize metrics like shares, retweets, and repins.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy creating amazing websites.
