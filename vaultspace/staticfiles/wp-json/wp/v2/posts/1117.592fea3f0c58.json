When was the last time you tried smart variations to see where they took your engagement and conversion numbers?<\/p>\n<p>Granted, <i>experimentation<\/i> can sound a bit intimidating. I know because I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs who feel that \u201csocial media tests\u201d are some obscure tactics only data scientists can handle.

I\u2019m writing this article to share seven simple tests that you can run today.<\/p>\n<p>But before we begin testing, you need to lay out some metrics to input your data in for analysis.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2 class=\"section-title section-title-default \" style=\"text-align: left;\">Setup Your Metrics for Documentation<\/h2>\n<div class=\"text-element content-element\">\n<p>To make sure your test results are as clear and informative as possible, decide which metrics matter for the changes you are trying to provoke. For example, if your main social media goal is to increase shares, prioritize metrics like shares, retweets, and repins.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, for each of the following test ideas, I\u2019ll be sharing two alternative social media post versions that you can try. When you think about these different versions, here\u2019s a handy format to collect data:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7844\" src=\"http:\/\/urbanpoint.modeltheme.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/living_room_02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1287\" srcset=\"https:\/\/urbanpoint.modeltheme.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/living_room_02.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/urbanpoint.modeltheme.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/living_room_02-600x402.jpg 600w, https:\/\/urbanpoint.modeltheme.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/living_room_02-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/urbanpoint.modeltheme.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/living_room_02-768x515.jpg 768w, https:\/\/urbanpoint.modeltheme.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/living_room_02-1024x686.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>They quote a 2009 study from Georgia Tech where over 1 million Pinterest graphics were evaluated to determine which colors were related with the most shared pins.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers concluded that red, purple and pink promote sharing, while green, black, blue and yellow all stop people from sharing.<\/p>\n<p>Considering that fonts can also play an instrumental role in how social media graphics are shared, launch two posts where the only difference is the font used to communicate the message.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trying to catch up with every new social network?
