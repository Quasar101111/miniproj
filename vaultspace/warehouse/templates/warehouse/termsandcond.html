    <h2>Payment and Lease Activation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>a.

    <h2>Storage Location</h2>
    <p>
        The Lessor agrees to store the Tenant's Goods in the designated warehouse location as specified in the lease agreement. The specific storage area within the facility is at the Lessor’s discretion unless explicitly agreed upon.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination of Lease and Storage</h2>

        <li><strong>a. Lease Duration:</strong> The lease is valid only for the period specified in the lease agreement. Any extension must be agreed upon by both the Tenant and Lessor, with payments made in advance.</li>
        <li><strong>b. Non-Payment:</strong> Failure to make timely payments for renewal or other charges (such as additional storage or services) may result in immediate termination of the Tenant’s access to the warehouse.

    </ul>

    <h2>Lessor’s Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
